Postmortem: Web Application Outage on 2024-08-15

Issue Summary
Duration:
Outage occurred on 2024-08-15 from 10:15 AM to 12:30 PM UTC (2 hours and 15 minutes).

Impact:
The web application, which handles online transactions for a retail client, experienced severe slowdowns, rendering the checkout process unusable for 80% of users. During the outage, users were unable to complete purchases, leading to a significant loss in revenue and customer trust.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the Nginx server settings, specifically in the caching mechanism, which led to resource exhaustion and significant performance degradation.

Timeline
10:15 AM:
Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating high response times on the checkout page.

10:20 AM:
Engineering team began investigating the issue. Initial assumption was that the database was under heavy load.

10:35 AM:
Database team confirmed that the database was operating normally, redirecting focus to the web server and application layers.

10:50 AM:
Misleading investigation into application code changes made earlier that day, which turned out to be unrelated.

11:10 AM:
Incident escalated to the DevOps team to investigate possible infrastructure issues.

11:30 AM:
Nginx server logs reviewed, revealing that the server was caching dynamic content, causing excessive memory usage and slow responses.

11:50 AM:
Misconfiguration identified in the Nginx settings. A temporary fix was applied by disabling the problematic caching rules.

12:10 PM:
Performance metrics returned to normal levels. Monitoring continued to ensure stability.

12:30 PM:
Issue fully resolved, with services operating at optimal levels.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause was a configuration error in the Nginx server, where dynamic content was incorrectly being cached. This led to excessive memory usage, as Nginx attempted to cache each unique request, overwhelming the server and causing severe slowdowns.

Resolution:
The resolution involved disabling the caching rules for dynamic content and restarting the Nginx service. Additionally, the configuration was updated to correctly differentiate between static and dynamic content to prevent future caching issues. The serverâ€™s performance was closely monitored post-fix to ensure stability.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Review Nginx Configurations:
Conduct a thorough review of all Nginx configurations to ensure that caching rules are correctly applied and that dynamic content is not inadvertently cached.

Improve Monitoring:
Enhance monitoring to include specific alerts for cache-related performance issues, particularly in the Nginx server.

Increase Logging:
Increase the verbosity of logs related to caching activities in Nginx to better detect similar issues in the future.

Incident Response Training:
Conduct incident response drills focused on misconfiguration and caching issues, ensuring the team can quickly identify and resolve such problems.

TODO:

[1 ] Audit and update Nginx configuration on all production servers.
[2 ] Implement detailed cache monitoring and alerts in the monitoring system.
[3 ] Create a runbook for dealing with Nginx performance issues, including common misconfigurations.
[4 ] Schedule regular training sessions on server configuration and incident response.
