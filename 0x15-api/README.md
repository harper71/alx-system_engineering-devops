### What Bash scripting should not be used for
Bash scripting is powerful for automation and command-line tasks but is not suitable for:
- Complex applications: Bash lacks the features and structure necessary for large, complex software.
- GUI applications: Bash is command-line oriented and not designed for graphical user interfaces.
- High-performance tasks: Bash scripts can be slow compared to compiled languages like C or optimized interpreted languages like Python.
- Error handling: Bash has limited error handling capabilities, which can lead to brittle scripts.
- Cross-platform portability: Bash is primarily for Unix-like systems; Windows support is limited.

### What is an API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, enabling integration and interaction between different systems.

### What is a REST API
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that adheres to the principles of REST, an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. REST APIs often return data in formats like JSON or XML.

### What are microservices
Microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service represents a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices communicate through APIs and enable flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

### What is the CSV format
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain text format for representing tabular data. Each line in a CSV file corresponds to a row in the table, with values separated by commas. The first line often contains headers, and subsequent lines contain data. Example:

```
Name, Age, City
Alice, 30, New York
Bob, 25, Los Angeles
```

### What is the JSON format
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON represents data as key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

### Pythonic Package and Module Name Style
- Packages and modules should have short, all-lowercase names.
- Underscores can be used if it improves readability.
- Example: `my_package`, `my_module`.

### Pythonic Class Name Style
- Class names should use the CapWords (CamelCase) convention.
- Example: `MyClass`, `EmployeeRecord`.

### Pythonic Variable Name Style
- Variable names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case).
- Example: `my_variable`, `employee_name`.

### Pythonic Function Name Style
- Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case).
- Example: `my_function`, `calculate_total`.

### Pythonic Constant Name Style
- Constant names should be in all uppercase with words separated by underscores.
- Example: `PI`, `MAX_SIZE`.

### Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
CapWords (CamelCase) in Python is a naming convention typically used for class names. It helps to distinguish class names from other types of identifiers like variables and functions, enhancing code readability and clarity. For example, `MyClass` versus `my_function` or `my_variable`.
