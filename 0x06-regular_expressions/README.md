A regular expression, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp," is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It's mainly used for pattern matching within strings. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful tools for text processing and manipulation because they allow you to define complex search patterns with a relatively simple syntax.

Here's a breakdown of how regular expressions work and how to write them:

Literal Characters: Literal characters match themselves. For example, the regular expression hello will match the string "hello" exactly.
Character Classes: Character classes allow you to specify a set of characters to match. For example:
[abc]: Matches any one of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
[0-9]: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
[a-z]: Matches any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.
Quantifiers: Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group of characters can appear.
*: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
+: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
?: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
{n}: Matches exactly 'n' occurrences of the preceding character or group.
{n,}: Matches 'n' or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
{n,m}: Matches between 'n' and 'm' occurrences of the preceding character or group.
Anchors: Anchors are used to specify the position of a match in a string.
^: Matches the start of a string.
$: Matches the end of a string.
\b: Matches a word boundary.
\B: Matches a non-word boundary.
Grouping and Capturing: Parentheses () are used to group parts of a regular expression together. They can also be used to capture matched text.
(abc): Matches the string "abc" and captures it.
(?:abc): Matches the string "abc" but does not capture it.
Alternation: Alternation allows you to match one of several patterns.
|: Matches either the pattern on its left or the pattern on its right.
()|(): Matches either the pattern inside the first set of parentheses or the pattern inside the second set.A regular expression, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp," is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
